<h1>C++ R Engine: Refactoring History</h1>

<p>This document describes the phases within the CXXR project to refactor the
R engine into C++. Each phase is placed within the Subversion
<code>tags</code> directory, with a name of the form <code>0.00-2.5.0</code>,
where <code>0.00</code> indicates the phase, and <code>2.5.0</code> indicates
the R release to which that phase is intended to correspond.</p>

<h2>Phase 0: <code>0.00-2.5.0</code></h2>

<p>In this phase all <code>.cpp</code> files within <code>src/main</code> are
renamed to <code>.cpp</code>, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>complex.c</code>: This file uses the C99 complex types, which are
    not understood by a C++ compiler;</li>
  <li><code>gram.c</code>: This file is automatically generated by
  yacc/bison;</li>
  <li><code>regex.c</code>: The source of this file is very insistent that it
    is C, not C++: it gives a #warning if you attempt to compile it with a
    C++ compiler.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result of this phase does not build correctly; however, it is useful
as a baseline for seeing the subsequent changes.</p>
