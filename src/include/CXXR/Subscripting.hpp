   /** @brief Services to support R subscripting operations.
     *
     * This class, all of whose members are static, encapsulates
     * services supporting subscripting of R vector objects, including
     * R matrices and arrays.
     *
     * @par Canonical index vectors:
     * A canonical index vector is an IntVector in which each element
     * is either NA or a strictly positive integer (representing an
     * index into a vector counting from one).  Various
     * <tt>canonicalize()</tt> functions are provided to convert other
     * forms of subscripting to the canonical form.
     *
     * @note Under certain circumstances, a canonical index vector may
     * have a <tt>use.names</tt> attribute.  This attribute should be
     * regarded as private to the Subscripting class, because its
     * implementation (or indeed its use at all) may change in the
     * future.
     *
     * @todo At present this class does not handle the special case
     * (described in sec. 3.4.2 of the R Language Definition) where
     * subscripting is being applied to an array, and there is a
     * single subscript which is a matrix with as many columns as the
     * array has dimensions, each row of the matrix being used to pick
     * out a single element of the array.
     *
     * @todo A matter for possible review is the fact that during
     * subsetting and subassignment operations, CXXR sometimes makes
     * deep copies of vectors of RHandle objects in cases where CR
     * gets away with simple pointer copies.
