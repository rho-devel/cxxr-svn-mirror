/** @file uncxxr.h

 * @brief Macros used to provide cues to the uncxxr.pl script.
 *
 * Where CR source files have been converted into C++ and otherwise
 * adapted for use in CXXR, the script uncxxr.pl tries as far as
 * possible to reverse the systematic changes.  It is used when
 * upgrading to a new version of R to distinguish substantive from
 * routine changes.
 *
 * This header file defines various macros that are used to provide
 * cues to uncxxr.pl to how it should operate: the macro expansions
 * defined below are the ones required in CXXR; uncxxr.pl will expand
 * them differently, reflecting CR usage.
