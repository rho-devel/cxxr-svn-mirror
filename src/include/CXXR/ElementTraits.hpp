	 *
	 * In some element types, including all the standard R atomic
	 * data types, the 'value' of a vector element is held
	 * directly in a data item of the element type \a T , and in
	 * that case a special value within the range of type \a T may
	 * be used to signify that an item of data is 'not available'.
	 *
	 * However, CXXR also allows the possibility that a vector
	 * element type \a T can be a class type whose objects contain
	 * a value of some underlying type, representing the data
	 * 'payload', along with a separate flag (typically a bool)
	 * indicating whether or not the data is 'not available'.
	 *
	 * This class provides facilities to allow generic programs to
	 * handle both these cases straightforwardly.  As defined
	 * here, the class deals with the first case described above;
	 * specializations of the Data template can be used to address
	 * the second case.
