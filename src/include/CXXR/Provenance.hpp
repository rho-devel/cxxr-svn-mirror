    /** @brief Provenance of a Frame::Binding state.
     *
     * This class records the provenance of an R binding, or more
     * accurately the provenance of the state of an R binding at a
     * particular time, where the state of a Frame::Binding in
     * particular includes its value.  However, for brevity, in the
     * documentation of this class we will use the expression "this
     * binding" to refer to the Frame::Binding object, <em>and the
     * state of that Frame::Binding object,</em> to which this
     * Provenance object relates.  (It should be understood that this
     * Frame::Binding object may subsequently have changed its state,
     * or ceased to exist altogether.)
     *
     * In particular a Provenance object records the time this binding
     * was established, and the top-level command that gave rise to
     * it.  It also maintains links to information about the
     * provenance of the parents and children of the binding.  The
     * parents of a binding state <em>b</em> are the binding states
     * which were read by the top-level command before creating the
     * binding state <em>b</em>, and may therefore have influenced the
     * state <em>b</em>; children are defined analogously.
     *
     * @par Xenogenesis:
     * Normally the value (and more generally) the state of a binding
     * created during the evaluation of a top-level command will
     * depend solely on the values of bindings previously read during
     * the evaluation of that top-level command, and possibly on other
     * aspects of the internal state of the R interpreter when
     * evaluation of the command started.  If this is \e not the case,
     * then the binding (state) is described as <b>xenogenous</b>, and
     * this property is recorded in the Provenance object.  Moreover,
     * if a binding is xenogenous, the \e value of the binding is also
     * recorded within the Provenance object.
