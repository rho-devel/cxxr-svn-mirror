    /** @brief Mechanism for deferred evaluation.
     *
     * This class is used to handle function arguments within R's lazy
     * evaluation scheme.  A Promise object encapsulates a pointer to
     * an arbitrary RObject (typically a Symbol or an Expression), and
     * a pointer to an Environment.  When the Promise is first
     * evaluated, the RObject is evaluated within the Environment, and
     * the result of evaluation returned as the value of the Promise.
     *
     * After the first evaluation, the result of evaluation is cached
     * within the Promise object, and the Environment pointer is set
     * null (thus possibly allowing the Environment to be
     * garbage-collected).  Subsequent evaluations of the Promise
     * object simply return the cached value.
     *
     * @note When a Promise is evaluated \e via a call to evaluate()
     * (the virtual function defined in class RObject), the \a env
     * parameter to evaluate() is ignored: evaluation uses only the
     * Environment encapsulated within the Promise object.  When an
     * RObject is known to be a Promise, it is suggested that
     * evaluation be carried out using the function Promise::force(),
     * which lacks the redundant parameter and is consequently clearer
     * to readers of the code.
