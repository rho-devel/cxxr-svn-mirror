     * the GCNode that it points to will not be garbage collected.
     *

     * intended for variables that are not allocated on the stack.
     * Unlike GCStackRoot objects, there is no requirement that GCRoot
     * objects be destroyed in the reverse order of their creation;
     * the price of this is that there is a slightly greater time overhead
     * to construction and destruction.
     *
     * It is not recommended to declare a GCRoot (or indeed any object
     * requiring non-trivial construction) at file or namespace scope
     * in circumstances where the order of initialisation of data in
     * different source files may be an issue.  See the way in which
     * <tt>Environment::s_base</tt> is declared and initialised in
     * Environment.cpp for a preferable approach.

     *           may be qualified by const, so for example a const
