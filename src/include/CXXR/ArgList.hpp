	 * whose tags are the same as those of the current list, but
	 * whose elements ('car' values) are the result of evaluating
	 * the corresponding elements of the current list within \a
	 * env.
	 *
	 * If an element of the list has value R_DotsSymbol, the
	 * binding of this Symbol within \a env is examined.  If it is
	 * bound to NULL or to Symbol::missingArgument()
	 * (R_MissingArg), this element of the current list is
	 * discarded.  If it is bound to a DottedArgs list, then this
	 * element of the current list is replaced by the one or more
	 * elements resulting from evaluating the elements of the
	 * DottedArgs list, and carrying across the corresponding
	 * tags.  If the DottedArgs list contains any elements with
	 * value Symbol::missingArgument(), these are carried through
	 * unchanged into the resulting list, irrespective of the
	 * setting of \a allow_missing.  Any other binding of
	 * R_DotsSymbol within \a env is an error.
	 *
	 * If any element of the current list has the value
	 * Symbol::missingArgument(), then this element of the list is
	 * carried through unchanged into the resulting list, unless
	 * \a allow_missing is false, in which case an error is
	 * raised.
	 *
	 * If any element of the current list has as value a Symbol
	 * missing within \a env, then this is converted in the
	 * resulting list into an element with the same tag but whose
	 * value is Symbol::missingArgument().  This applies unless \a
	 * allow_missing is false, in which case an error is raised.
	 *
	 * After the call, the ArgList will have Status EVALUATED; it
	 * is an error to call this function if the ArgList already
	 * has Status EVALUATED.
	 *
	 * @param env The Environment in which evaluations are to take
	 *          place.  If firstArg() has previously been called
	 *          for this ArgList, then \a env must be identical to
	 *          the \a env argument of that firstArg() call.
	 *
	 * @param allow_missing This affects the handling of any
	 *          elements of the current list whose value is either
	 *          Symbol::missingArgument() or a Symbol which is
	 *          missing within \a env.  If \a allow_missing is
	 *          true, such elements are carried through unchanged
	 *          into the resulting list; otherwise, such elements
	 *          cause an error to be raised.

	 * This function accesses the value of the first argument in
	 * the ArgList, evaluating it in \a env if the ArgList has not
	 * already been evaluated.
	 *
	 * However, if the first argument is DotsSymbol (...), the
	 * binding of this Symbol within \a env is examined.  If it is
	 * bound to a DottedArgs list, the return value is the value
	 * of the first element is this DottedArgs list, evaluated if
	 * necessary.
	 *
	 * In seeking the first argument of the ArgList, the function
	 * ignores any initial elements of the ArgList whose value is
	 * DotsSymbol (...) if the binding of this Symbol within \a
	 * env is NULL or Symbol::missingArgument().  Any other binding of
	 * DotsSymbol is an error; it is also an error is a DotsSymbol
	 * argument is encountered but DotsSymbol is unbound within \a
	 * env.
	 *
	 * If evaluation of the first argument takes place, the class
	 * records this fact, and takes steps to ensure that it is not
	 * subsequently reevaluated.
	 *
	 * @param env Pointer to the Environment in which the first
	 *          argument is to be evaluated.  If the ArgList has
	 *          already been evaluated, this pointer can be null.
	 *

	 * first argument was found, then the first element of the

	/** @brief Wrap elements of the argument list in Promise
	 * objects.
	 *
	 * Basically, this function wraps any argument in the ArgList
	 * whose value is not Symbol::missingArgument() in a Promise
	 * to be evaluated in \a env.  However, if the ArgList
	 * currently has Status EVALUATED, the \a env parameter is
	 * ignored, and the function simply wraps the argument values
	 * in pre-forced Promise objects.
	 *
	 * If any argument has the value CXXR::DotsSymbol, the action
	 * depends on what this Symbol is bound to within \a env (and
	 * its enclosing environments).  If it is unbound, or bound to
	 * a null pointer or to Symbol::missingArgument(), then this
	 * element of the ArgList is discarded.  If it is bound to a
	 * DottedArgs list, then the elements of that list are added
	 * to the ArgList as arguments in their own right, with each
	 * argument value being wrapped in a Promise to be evaluated
	 * in \a env.  Any other binding of DotsSymbol is an error.
	 *
	 * Any tags in the ArgList or in a DottedArgs list are carried
	 * across to the corresponding element of the modified list, but
	 * coerced using tag2Symbol() into a form suitable for
	 * argument matching.
	 *
	 * After the call, the ArgList will have Status PROMISED; it
	 * is an error to call this function if the ArgList already
	 * has Status PROMISED.
	 *
	 * @param env Pointer to the Environment to which Promises in
	 *          the output list are to be keyed.  As noted above,
	 *          this parameter is ignored if the ArgList has
	 *          Status EVALUATED.  Otherwise, if firstArg() has
	 *          previously been called for this ArgList, then \a
	 *          env must be identical to the \a env argument of
	 *          that firstArg() call.
	 *
	 * @note It would be desirable to avoid producing a new
	 * PairList, and to absorb this functionality directly into
	 * the ArgMatcher::match() function.  But at present the
	 * Promise-wrapped list is recorded in the context set up by
	 * Closure::apply(), and used for other purposes.
