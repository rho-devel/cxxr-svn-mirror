    /** @brief Replacement for CR's SEXPREC.
     *
     * This class is the rough equivalent within CXXR of the SEXPREC
     * union within CR.  However, all functionality relating to
     * garbage collection has been factored out into the base class
     * GCNode, and as CXXR development proceeds other functionality
     * will be factored out into derived classes (corresponding
     * roughly, but not exactly, to different SEXPTYPEs within CR), or
     * outside the RObject hierarchy altogether.
     *
     * Eventually this class may end up simply as the home of R
     * attributes.
     *
     * @note The word 'object' in the name of this class is used in
     * the sense in which the 'blue book' (Becker <em>et al.</em>
     * [1988]) uses the phrase 'data object'.  Roughly speaking,
     * CXXR::RObject is a base class for the sorts of data items whose
     * existence would be reported by the R function
     * <tt>objects()</tt>.  In particular, it does not imply that
     * the object belongs to an R class.
     *
     * @invariant The class currently aims to enforce the following
     * invariants in regard to each RObject:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li><tt>m_has_class</tt> is true iff the object has the class
     * attribute.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute in the list of attributes must have a Symbol
     * as its tag.  Null tags are not allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute must have a distinct tag: no duplicates
     * allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>No attribute may have a null value: an attempt to set the
     * value of an attribute to null will result in the removal of the
     * attribute altogether.
     * </ul>
     * The CR code in attrib.cpp applies further consistency
     * conditions on attributes, but these are not yet enforced via
     * the class interface.
     *
     * @todo Incorporate further attribute consistency checks within
     * the class interface.  Possibly make setAttribute() virtual so
     * that these consistency checks can be tailored according to the
     * derived class.
     *
     * @todo Possibly key attributes on (cached) strings rather than
     * Symbol objects.
