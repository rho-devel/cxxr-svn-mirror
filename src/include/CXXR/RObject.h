    /** @brief Replacement for CR's ::SEXPREC.
     *
     * This class is the rough equivalent within CXXR of the SEXPREC
     * union within CR.  However, all functionality relating to
     * garbage collection has been factored out into the base class
     * GCNode, and as CXXR development proceeds other functionality
     * will be factored out into derived classes (corresponding
     * roughly, but not exactly, to different ::SEXPTYPE values within
     * CR), or outside the RObject hierarchy altogether.
     *
     * Eventually this class may end up simply as the home of R
     * attributes.
     *
     * @note The word 'object' in the name of this class is used in
     * the sense in which the 'blue book' (Becker <em>et al.</em>
     * [1988]) uses the phrase 'data object'.  Roughly speaking,
     * CXXR::RObject is a base class for the sorts of data items whose
     * existence would be reported by the R function
     * <tt>objects()</tt>.  In particular, it does not imply that
     * the object belongs to an R class.
     *
     * @invariant The class currently aims to enforce the following
     * invariants in regard to each RObject:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li><tt>m_has_class</tt> is true iff the object has the class
     * attribute.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute in the list of attributes must have a Symbol
     * as its tag.  Null tags are not allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>Each attribute must have a distinct tag: no duplicates
     * allowed.</li>
     *
     * <li>No attribute may have a null value: an attempt to set the
     * value of an attribute to null will result in the removal of the
     * attribute altogether.
     * </ul>
     * The CR code in attrib.cpp applies further consistency
     * conditions on attributes, but these are not yet enforced via
     * the class interface.
     *
     * @par <tt>const RObject*</tt> policy:
     * There is an inherent tension between the way CR is implemented
     * and the 'const-correctness' that C++ programmers seek, and this
     * particularly arises in connection with pointers to objects of
     * classes derived from RObject.  CR accesses such objects
     * exclusively using ::SEXP, which is a non-const pointer.  (The
     * occasional use within the CR code of <tt>const SEXP</tt> is
     * misguided: the compiler interprets this in effect as
     * <tt>RObject* const</tt>, not as <tt>const RObject*</tt>.)  One
     * possible policy would be simply never to use <tt>const T*</tt>,
     * where \c T is \c RObject* or a class inheriting from it: that
     * would remove any need for <tt>const_cast</tt>s at the interface
     * between new CXXR code and code inherited from CR.  But CXXR
     * tries to move closer to C++ idiom than that, notwithstanding
     * the resulting need for <tt>const_cast</tt>s at the interface,
     * and applies a policy driven by the following considerations:
     * <ol>
     *
     * <li>RObject::evaluate() cannot return a <code>const
     * RObject*</code>, because some functions return a pointer to an
     * <code>Environment</code>, which may well need subsequently to
     * be modified e.g. by inserting or changing bindings.</li>
     *
     * <li>This in turn means that RObject::evaluate() cannot itself
     * be a <code>const</code> function, because the default
     * implementation returns <code>this</code>. (Another view would
     * be that the default implementation is an elided copy.)  Also,
     * Promise objects change internally when they are evaluated
     * (though this might conceivably be swept up by
     * <code>mutable</code>).</li>
     *
     * <li>It is a moot point whether FunctionBase::apply() can be
     * <code>const</code>.  Closure::apply() entails evaluating the
     * body, and if the body is regarded as part of the Closure
     * object, that would point to <code>apply()</code> not being
     * <code>const</code>. (Note that some of the types which
     * Rf_mkCLOSXP() accepts as a Closure body use the default
     * RObject::evaluate(), so Point&nbsp;2 definitely applies.)</li>
     *
     * <li>Should PairList objects and suchlike emulate (roughly
     * speaking) (a) <code>list&lt;pair&lt;const RObject*, const
     * RObject*&gt; &gt;</code> (where the first element of the pair
     * is the tag and the second the 'car'),
     * (b) <code>list&lt;pair&lt;const RObject*, RObject*&gt;
     * &gt;</code> or (c) <code>list&lt;pair&lt;RObject*, RObject*&gt;
     * &gt;</code> ? Since the 'cars' of list elements will often need
     * to be evaluated, Point&nbsp;2 rules out (a).  At present CXXR
     * follows (b).</li>
     *
     * <li>Since Symbol objects may well need to be evaluated,
     * Symbol::obtain() returns a non-const pointer; similarly,
     * CachedString::obtain() returns a non-const pointer to a
     * CachedString object.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * @todo Incorporate further attribute consistency checks within
     * the class interface.  Possibly make setAttribute() virtual so
     * that these consistency checks can be tailored according to the
     * derived class.
